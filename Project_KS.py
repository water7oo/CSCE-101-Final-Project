# FINAL PROJECT: AIM LABS

#Pseudo Code

# Aim training game, click the turtle with your mouse,
# turtle moves to a random spot within the screens range, track the time
# it takes the person to click each turtle
# A game timer will tick down (30 secs? 60 secs?)
# Final score will be calculated (Average time per click, total turtles killed)


# Average time per click: timer will run, when player clicks turtle, timer will reset to 0 (log and append all times in a list, then find average time taken)
# Each turtle is 100 points, (maybe inforporate a golden turtle??? = 300 points?)
# Could have a situation where more than 1 turtle spawns????

## Tasks ##

# Make turtle spawn in random spot
# Allow player to click turtle, then turtle goes to a random spot on the screen
# Have timer go up from 0 (time.delta time???, Time resets when turtle is clicked, have boolean triggers when turtle is clicked)
# compile the last time documented before reset happens, then throw it into a list (append it)
# Have score counter
# When game is finished tally points and give a final score
# give the player the option to play again, this resets the game timer to 60 or 30 and runs the while loop again
